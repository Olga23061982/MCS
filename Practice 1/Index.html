   <h1 id="reference 1">Anton Pavlovich Chekhov</h1> 
   <p align="justify">Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (Russian: Антон Павлович Чехов; 29 January 1860 – 15 July 1904) was a Russian playwright and short-story writer 
    who is considered to be one of the greatest writers of all time. His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short 
    stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred 
    to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. Chekhov was a physician by profession. 
    "Medicine is my lawful wife", he once said, "and literature is my mistress."
    Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin 
    Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays, Three Sisters 
    and The Cherry Orchard. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, because in place of 
    conventional action Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text". The plays that Chekhov wrote were not complex,
    but easy to follow, and created a somewhat haunting atmosphere for the audience.
  
    Chekhov at first wrote stories to earn money, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations that influenced the evolution 
    of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was 
    to ask questions, not to answer them.

    <h2 id="reference 2">The Seagull.</h2>
    <p align="justify">The Seagull (Russian: Ча́йка, tr. Cháyka) is a play by Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, written in 1895 and first produced in 1896. 
    The Seagull is generally considered to be the first of his four major plays. It dramatises the romantic and artistic conflicts 
    between four characters: the famous middlebrow story writer Boris Trigorin, the ingenue Nina, the fading actress Irina Arkadina, 
    and her son the symbolist playwright Konstantin Treplev.</p>
    <p align="justify">Like Chekhov's other full-length plays, The Seagull relies upon an ensemble cast of diverse, fully developed characters. In contrast
    to the melodrama of mainstream 19th-century theatre, lurid actions (such as Konstantin's suicide attempts) are not shown onstage. 
    Characters tend to speak in ways that skirt around issues rather than addressing them directly; in other words, their lines are 
    full of what is known in dramatic practice as subtext. The character Trigorin is considered one of Chekhov's greatest male roles.
    The opening night of the first production was a famous failure. Vera Komissarzhevskaya, playing Nina, was so intimidated by the 
    hostility of the audience that she lost her voice. Chekhov left the audience and spent the last two acts behind the scenes. 
    When supporters wrote to him that the production later became a success, he assumed that they were merely trying to be kind.
    When Konstantin Stanislavski, the seminal Russian theatre practitioner of the time, directed it in 1898 for his Moscow Art Theatre,
    the play was a triumph. Stanislavski's production became "one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and 
    one of the greatest new developments in the history of world drama".</p>

    <p align="justify">Stanislavski's direction caused The Seagull to be perceived as a tragedy through overzealousness with the concept of subtext, 
    hereas Chekhov intended it to be a comedy.
